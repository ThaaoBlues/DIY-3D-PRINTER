# DIY-3D-PRINTER
Here I will put explainations and firmware source code on how I'm making a 3D printer from old inkjet printer parts !

## Hardware used :
  - 3 inkjet printer axis
  - 1 arduino Una board
  - One computer with Python and arduino IDE installed
  - I will add the rest as I complete the building of the printer.

## Task list :
  - [ ] Get 3 axis : 1/3
  - [ ] Make printer firmware : 1/100
  - [ ] Make desktop app : 1/100
  - [ ] Find a good 3D printer head : 0/100
  - [ ] Find a way to power all components : 30/100
